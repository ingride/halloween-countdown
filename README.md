# HALL🎃WEEN COUNTDOWN

Some people get excited about Christmas months in advance and start decorating the Xmas tree. 

I'm not one of them. I 🖤🖤🖤🖤(...)🖤 Halloween instead, and get ridiculously excited thinking about it months! in advance. 
For those of you that can relate, I built a countdown to our favorite holiday. 


### Why would you even!? / Disclaimer: 
Couple reasons: 
- 🧛🏻‍♀️ I aim to be more creative when it comes to coding by building silly little projects that teach me something new
- 👻 I wanted to draw something in CSS ( which I've never done before ). So go easy on me, it's meant to be fun, not production code.

## ENJ🎃Y!
